#Welcome to nimble blog.

##getting started with development is easy.

- [start by downloading the google app engine SDK](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads)

- clone and cd into the repo. I reccomend setting up a virtualenv virtual environment, but it is not necessary if further modules will not be added, as all modules currently reside in lib and are incorporated through [GAE's reccomended method](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/using-libraries-python-27)

- then run the command  `dev_appserver.py /home/vince/Dropbox/TZU/UD/nimble/default`

- if you receive command not found errors, check your PATH configuration and/or reinstall the GAE SDK.

Have fun!
